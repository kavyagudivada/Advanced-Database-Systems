 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*jpg and *csv, not this quiz) to cloud service.

     On that same page, allow a user to give an id value (such as "ak020921jc6m"), then please show 
     the details of that quake (if it exists), location (lat, long, place name), mag, time, depth.
     If there are any other quakes with the same mag (same mag plus or minus 0.1 mag), please list
     those as well.

 <div id="title_bar" class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">

 <form action="/eq" method="POST">
                    Display the id : <input type="text" name="name" required="1">
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success ">Submit</button>
                </form>

@app.route('/eq', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def eq():
    eql = request.form['name']
    # name=room
    db2conn = ibm_db.connect("DATABASE=BLUDB;HOSTNAME=dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-dal09-10.services.dal.bluemix.net;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=dbq96152;PWD=x@68wmv7qznf1h2n;",

        stmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(db2conn, sql)

        ibm_db.close(db2conn)
        print(rows1)
    return render_template('name.html', data=rows , data1=rows1)
  6. (Web page) Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     (those two locations create a boundary, a box) and a depth range (for example from 2 to 20),
     then: display the 3 largest mag quakes within that (bounding) box, please display the id, location (as above),
     the mag, and time.

  7. (Web page), Allow a user to give a part of a location name (for example "Yellowstone" or "Alaska"), 
     and a depth range (for example from 2 to 200), and a distance (for example 550 km), 
     and show the largest magnitude quake (if one exists), within that distance.
     Note, that there may be several locations in Alaska within that given depth range, 
     so list the largest mag quake for each.
     Please display the lat, long, mag, place, depth and date for each.
    
  8. (Similar to part 6, with some modification)
     Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     (those two locations create a boundary, a box), and a value N, then: 
     display the N largest mag quakes within that (bounding) box, (display lat, long, place, mag, time and id)
     then allow a user to choose any of those quakes (displayed) and modify any of the values: 
     lat, long, place, mag, time and id.

  9. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 5, 6, 7, 8

  10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
      If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
      the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
